________

A repository of projects designed following C++ tutorials, to demonstrate my aptitude in using the language.

"01 LearnCPPDotCom" pertains to my current progress learning the tutorials on the aforementioned website.

"02 FreeCodeCampOld" pertains to old tutorials that I learnt from a video on YouTube, which after researching I learnt that
they do not teach best practice in regard to certain princples of C++, and was recommended to pursue LearnCPP.com instead.
