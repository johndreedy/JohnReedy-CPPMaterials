________

A repository of projects designed following C++ tutorials, to demonstrate my aptitude in using the language.

"01 LearnCPP.Com" pertains to my current progress learning the tutorials on the aforementioned website. I am using Visual Studio 2022 and each
lesson I have learnt can be found in the respective lesson folders.

"02 FreeCodeCampOld" pertains to old tutorials that I learnt from a 4-hour video on YouTube - after researching I learnt that
they do not teach best practice in regard to certain princples of C++, and was recommended to pursue LearnCPP.com instead for a better
overall foundation in the language. I was using Code::Blocks as my IDE.
